# Video-Editing-App

## Overview -

<p>
This web application allows users to perform basic video editing operations such as video trimming and applying slow-motion effects. The application is developed using AngularJS and is deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. You can access the deployed application - <a href="https://video-editing-app.vercel.app/">video-editing-app</a>
</p>

## Deployment
The application is deployed using Vercel. You can access the deployed application <a href="https://video-editing-app.vercel.app/">video-editing-app</a>

## Features
<ul>
  <li><strong> Video Upload:</strong> Users can upload videos from their local system.</li>
  <li><strong> Video Trimming:</strong> Users can trim videos to select specific parts.</li>
  <li><strong> Slow-Motion Effects:</strong> Users can apply slow-motion effects to their videos.</li>
  <li><strong> Video Download:</strong> Edited videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges and Resolutions
### API Integration
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> The video editing API that supports the required features (background removal) is a paid service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resolution:</strong> The paid API restricted its usage in the project. Therefore, the background removal feature could not be fully implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>API Reference:</strong> I attempted to integrate the Unscreen API for background removal. However, due to its paid nature, it was not feasible to include it in the project. You can refer to the API documentation here <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

## Future Improvements
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Background Removal:</strong> Integrate a suitable API for background removal that fits within project constraints.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhanced Functionality:</strong> Improve existing features for a better user experience.
  </li>
</ul>

## Conclusion
Despite some challenges, the project demonstrates core functionalities such as video trimming and applying slow-motion effects. I look forward to further discussions and feedback.
