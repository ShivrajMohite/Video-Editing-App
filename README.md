## Challenges and Resolutions
### API Integration
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> The video editing API that supports the required features (background removal) is a paid service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resolution:</strong> The paid API restricted its usage in the project. Therefore, the background removal feature could not be fully implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>API Reference:</strong> I attempted to integrate the <strong>Unscreen API</strong> for background removal. However, due to its paid nature, it was not feasible to include it in the project. You can refer to the API documentation here <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

## Future Improvements
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Background Removal:</strong> Integrate a suitable API for background removal that fits within project constraints.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhanced Functionality:</strong> Improve existing features for a better user experience.
  </li>
</ul>
